# sd-copy

Copies your photos from a SD card to your computer.
Change the source and target appropriately.

Files are copied to a date based folder structure to help organize your photo library.

The folder structure is:
```
   TARGET = ~/Pictures
              +-- /2016
                  +-- /2016-01-01 New Years
                  |   +-- 0000001.JPG
                  |
                  +-- /2016-01-02
                      +-- 0000002.JPG
                                 
```

The script will create the necessary directories and allows for custom names.
